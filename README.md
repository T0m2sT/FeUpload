## Business Modelling

Business modeling in software development involves defining the product's vision, understanding market needs, aligning features with user expectations, and setting the groundwork for strategic planning and execution.

### Product Vision

<!-- 
Start by defining a clear and concise product vision for your app, to help members of the team, contributors, and users into focusing their often disparate views into a concise, visual, and short textual form. 

The vision should provide a "high concept" of the product for marketers, developers, and managers.

A product vision describes the essential of the product and sets the direction to where a product is headed, and what the product will deliver in the future. 

**We favor a catchy and concise statement, ideally one sentence.**

We suggest you use the product vision template described in the following link:
* [How To Create A Convincing Product Vision To Guide Your Team, by uxstudioteam.com](https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/product-vision/)

To learn more about how to write a good product vision, please read:

## Requirements

### User Stories
<!-- 
In this section you should describe all kinds of requirements for your module: functional and non-functional requirements.

For LEIC-ES-2025-26, the requirements will be gathered and documented as user stories. 

Please add in this section a concise summary of all the user stories (not each user story!).

**User stories as GitHub Project Items**
The user stories themselves should be created and described as items in your GitHub Project with the label "user story". 

A user story is a description of a desired functionality told from the perspective of the user or customer. A starting template for the description of a user story is *As a < user role >, I want < goal > so that < reason >.*

Name the item with either the full user story or a shorter name (recommended). In the “comments” field, add relevant notes, mockup images, and acceptance test scenarios, linking to the acceptance tests when available, and finally estimate value and effort.

**INVEST in good user stories**. 
You may add more details after, but the shorter and complete, the better. In order to decide if the user story is good, please follow the [INVEST guidelines](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).

**User interface mockups**.
After the user story text, you should add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockup or draft, if applicable.

**Acceptance tests**.
For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)), i.e., a description of scenarios (situations) that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed by the user story.

**Value and effort**.
At the end, it is good to add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method) and the team should add an estimation of the effort to implement it using points in a kind-of-a Fibonnacci scale (1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40, no idea).

-->

The platform will allow its users to efficiently browse through old exams and exercise sheets, as well as notes and summaries provided by other students and other study material that will help students with their academic life.
Users can contribute to the platform by publishing the material and annotations they made and/or used and help the community grow.
All the material will be neatly organized and sorted based on relevance and popularity. A rating system, where users will be able to vote and rate posts, will be put in place for that purpose, along with the ability to bookmark and group material for easy organization and access. The users will also be allowed to filter out solved/unsolved material.
As a finishing touch, the platform will integrate Artificial Intelligence to aid users during their study by providing extra study content or answers to difficult questions.


### Domain model

<!-- 
To better understand the context of the software system, it is useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all and only the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your app. 
Also provide a short textual description of each concept (domain class). 

Example:
 <p align="center" justify="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/templates/blob/main/images/DomainModel.png"/>
</p>
-->


## Architecture and Design
<!--
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its organization. 

A well written architecture document is brief and reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them. 

In this section you should start by briefly describing the components of the project and their interrelations. You should describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.
-->


### Logical architecture
<!--
The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code (Logical View), using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.

It can be beneficial to present the system in a horizontal decomposition, defining layers and implementation concepts, such as the user interface, business logic and concepts.

Example of _UML package diagram_ showing a _logical view_ of the Eletronic Ticketing System (to be accompanied by a short description of each package):

![LogicalView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9655877/160585416-b1278ad7-18d7-463c-b8c6-afa4f7ac7639.png)
-->


### Physical architecture
<!--
The goal of this subsection is to document the high-level physical structure of the software system (machines, connections, software components installed, and their dependencies) using UML deployment diagrams (Deployment View) or component diagrams (Implementation View), separate or integrated, showing the physical structure of the system.

It should describe also the technologies considered and justify the selections made. Examples of technologies relevant for ESOF are, for example, frameworks for mobile applications (such as Flutter).

Example of _UML deployment diagram_ showing a _deployment view_ of the Eletronic Ticketing System (please notice that, instead of software components, one should represent their physical/executable manifestations for deployment, called artifacts in UML; the diagram should be accompanied by a short description of each node and artifact):

![DeploymentView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9655877/160592491-20e85af9-0758-4e1e-a704-0db1be3ee65d.png)
-->


### Functional prototype
<!--
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a functional prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system integrating as much technologies as we can.

In this subsection please describe which feature, or part of it, you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a small part of a feature that demonstrates thay you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).
-->

## Project management
<!--
Software project management is the art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which they are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we recommend each team to adopt a set of project management practices and tools capable of registering tasks, assigning tasks to team members, adding estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Common practices of managing agile software development with Scrum are: backlog management, release management, estimation, Sprint planning, Sprint development, acceptance tests, and Sprint retrospectives.

You can find below information and references related with the project management: 

* Backlog management: Product backlog and Sprint backlog in a [Github Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2023-24/projects/64);
* Release management: [v0](#), v1, v2, v3, ...;
* Sprint planning and retrospectives: 
  * plans: screenshots of Github Projects board at begin and end of each Sprint;
  * retrospectives: meeting notes in a document in the repository, addressing the following questions:
    * Did well: things we did well and should continue;
    * Do differently: things we should do differently and how;
    * Puzzles: things we don’t know yet if they are right or wrong;
    * list of a few improvements to implement next Sprint;
